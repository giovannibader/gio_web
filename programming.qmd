Software like SAS and R and Python have some basic built in functions. But more handy or advanced function can be installed later. And because R and Python are free and open system many users are contributing with the creation of new specialized packages.

download and install R https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.1-win.exe

download and install RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

`install.packages("readxl")`

`library("readxl")`

`new_file <- read_excel("c:\folder\folder\File_Name.xlsx")`

and now some summary statistics

`summary(new_file)`
