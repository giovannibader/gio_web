|This website is by nature work in progress as my life.                                                                                                               |
|It is done with R, a software originally designed to do statistics. But now R is doing more things and beyond learning AI modules or new Machine Learning algorithms |
|I am also learning how to build a website with this technology. I built my first website with HTML but that was 25 years ago..                                       |

|I am a physician and have been treating patients for more than 10 years. Medicine is an art. Qualitative Medicine.                                                   |
|Then I discovered that my heart beats for quantitative Medicine. Good science to treat as many patients as possible. Here lies my ethics.                            |
|Appropriate medicine to the appropriate patient. A value lost....
