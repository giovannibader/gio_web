I disagree with the dominant culture of fake-freedom, of fake-news, of fake-values of fake-knowledge. I can`t forget who I am, what I did and where I go.
I am not able to stay on the surface, I need to dive and go deep. I am an explorer and, unfortunately, not a yes-man.

From brilliant minds from the past to the Black Holes, from fermions to squat, from Gauss to R packages doing magic things. I'm also considering buying a telescope to take pictures of the universe. Galileo Galilei fought the established culture like a salmon, always against the mainstream. So, I'm inspired by people like Gaius Iulius Caesar, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Bernhard Riemann, Aristarch and many more, because they were original thinkers, not following the crawd.
