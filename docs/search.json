    "text": "Here, I like to look back and remind things I have build, projects I have contributed to, people I have met and friends made along the journey. Starting from the …beginning\nChapter 1: the birth of an explorer\nMy research career started one day back in 1991 at the Department of Internal Medicine (Univeristy of Ferrara, IT) when my friend and colleague (now Prof) Giovanni Zuliani suggested to look into a lipid particle, recently discovered. It was called Lipoprotein (a). Function unknown but probably high blood levels were associated with high cardiovascular risk. Luckily the Head of Department (Prof Fellin) knew an expert in lipoproteins measurement and few months later I was working with Prof Kostner in his Biochemistry department in Graz. Centrifuge, ultracentrifuge, pipetting, eppendorf, agarose, SDS-PAGE, isoelectrofocusing, ELISA , DELFIA. What a fun days. I remember, I was in the lab already at 4 am. excited and anxious to carry on my next experiment. I had the idea to characterize the size of this particle by measuring its mobility on acrylamide gel. It was a good idea but prof Kostner informed me that prof Utermann (University of Innsbruck) had the same idea. In the end we published the finding together.\nI learned also how to measure the phenotype of apo E through electrofocusing.\nMeanwhile Prof Zuliani was carrying on a cohort study in a small remote italian village charactized by people reaching old age in pretty good health condition and he was studying the predictors of longevity. We did some analysis in order to assess the level of Lp(a) and its isoforms along with the apo E phenotyping on a sample of octuagenarians. And we did apo E because already at that time we knew about the association of Apo E with Alzheimer’s disease.\nLots of sample, lots of data. I started to perform analysis by my own and the interest for data and statistics grown since then. I started with a statistical package on a Apple computer. I was leaving the lab very late because on the same desktop was installed the first version of DOOM. I don’t remember if it was a legal or pirated version. I remember the fun and the competition among the lab folk. Thank you Anton for teaching me all the lab techniques , helping me with the car in that cold morning and for letting me win with DOOM.\nI have been in Graz (I have been told that my anchestors were coming from that city, but this is the subject for another story) for one year. I went back to my home Department after working one year in the ward and in the outpatients clinic I had the opportunity to join the Friedrikson lab at NIH, Bethesda, USA. The lab belonging to the Molecular Disease Branch, NHLBI, was led by Bryan Brewer. Thank you Bryan and Bob for your patience with me. Again I was challenged with the mistery of Lp(a). The idea was to take the blood from people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (high apo B) and people without apo B and inject radioiodinated Lp(a) and apo (a) to understand the metabolism (from the shape of the decay curve). So I learned to use the SAAM software to solve the equations for the decay and also collected a lot of urine samples (in the middle of the night too). Indeed I found apo(a) almost intact in the urine. Masato Nishiwaki was a researched from Japan and I am so grateful I met him. He has been to kindest and most knowledgeable guy I have ever met. We spent so many hours talking about lipids, atherosclerosis and eating large peperoni pizzas (Domino) and drinking so many cans of beer. Thank you Masato for everything you did for me. I had nothing to give you in return. I remember Nao (Japan), Minna Hannuksela, Hassan Nazih. Building 10, 7 floor, has been our house for 2 years. Then finally I was offered with 5 years contract. Meanwhile I was collaborating with Dr Angelo Scanu team (thank you Celina) and I was intrigued by the idea to move in Chicago and continue to dive into the mistery of Lp(a).\nWinter 1996. The worse time in my life. I was told by my boss in Italy to come back because he managed to secure a perment position in the Internal Medicine Department. So I had to say goodbye and cancel my 5 years contract at NIH. My wife didn’t like the Washington area and she told me that she wouldn’t follow me in US. For Christmas I have been invited (with my wife) by my boss for dinner. During the meal my boss told me, seraphically, that I have to continue to do research abroad, no position was available, no job. At the age of 37 I had to reinvent myself.\nChapter 2: choices and the good the bad and the hugly of the industry\nAt that time to work and learn at the Internal Medicine Department I had (as many other of my generation) to work during the night in private clinics or in the emergency department on the territory to earn some money. During my specialization in Endocrinology and Metabolism (5 years) and my PhD (4 years) in those years I was working at the Unversity during the day for free. And my parents supported me in all my travelling. They invested in me. Thank you papa’, thank you mamma.\nLate 1997 I was struggling between my dream of a career in the academia (I always loved teaching) and the need for a job. I remember one day I started not going to the University every day any more. I was involved more and more with a job that eventually became permanent in a private clinic. Thank you Prof Pellegrini for letting me in. One day I felt like a stranger in the Departemnt of Internal Medicine. I realized that the dream was over. I cried.\nI have many memories of the private clinic. I developed aversion for religion, any religion or I should say fanatism, at that time. A 50 years old man died in front of his family (parents, wife, 2 daughters). He had a bleeding gastric ulcer and because his belief he refused the blood transfusion. I couldn’t safe him because his religion. And I starte to ask myself if we really need god to die. The answer was no. We die anyway.\nEarly 1998. I was in the ambulatory of the private clinic and a commercial representative from Company A told me the its company was looking for a diabetologist. Then I met Alessandro. Alessandro Coppini. It was a blast. Immediate connection. I was taken. By the personality maybe. But was enough for me to move my family in Pisa. The house had the sea in front and the hills (with olive trees) on the back. Romantic. The ideal place to raise our first kid, Edoardo. But the birth took place in Venice. The North-East of Italy is my country. I was born and will die there, not in Italy but in Veneto.\nHappy memories. In Company A I met the nicest guy in the industry. Pasquale Di Coste. Head of Marketing. What a gentleman. Known by every diabetologists in Italy. They were competing to have Pasquale attention or a call from him. Pasquale was generous, kind, knowledgeable, a listener, humble and leader at the same time. Also heavy smoker. In those years I learned everything we need to know in Medical Affairs, now forgotten. I did registration studies and registered a drug (combination) with few regulatory colleagues. At the same time I was visiting diabetologists on the teriitory with reps. I remember memorable dinners in Sicily, in Sardinia. I remember the hours spent in training reps. And after a while they were coming back and say that physicians were impressed by how the rep was presenting our orals and insulins. I also remember developing a new CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) for measuring glucose for 72 hours. What a fun to analyse the data (Clarkson grid). But the second son was coming , Niccolo’. Money were again a concern. In addition in the overall picture I was missing the holistic approach. We had simvastatin and lacidipine but no vision for the disease, atherosclerosis.\nSo, Company B came in early 2000. The Marketing department was looking for MDs to be deployed on the territory to collaborate with Institutions, physicians and payers on projects. At the beginning it was training on DRG but then I developed my own area of expertise. I started to analyse data from hospitals, claims, EMR etc. And presenting the results to the Hospitals General Manager to let them understand the impact and value of the drugs in their hospitals and territory.\nMy analyses were somehow popular and I remember that I was performing all kind of analysis for labs, for neurologists, for cardiologists, reumatologists. So I learned that every specialty has different statistics. I started to do training in statistics at Universities. I have been working for the italian chapter of the OMERACT. Strikingly the Friuli Venezia Giulia asked to Company B for my help to analyse their data and paid me a fellowship (thank you Dr Diego Vanuzzo). I remember dr Nicola Bottazzo, Head of the Laboratory from an Hospital from the North-East. I remember dr Sakis Themistoclakis (thank you Sakis for testing my heart for flutter).\nWith all the specialists I met we had very productive collaboration and many publication. Campnay B (reps) always had the dooors open to their office thanks to this “service”.\nAt that time I was mainly using Stata after SPSS, Statgraphics, Statiatica, Systat and many more statistical packages. I think I have used them all. I started to look into the life of early statisticians to understand what sort of questions they had to develop statistical techniques. I bought many books and read and studied them all, avidly. Fermat, Descartes, Bernoulli, Gauss etc. I expanded my reading and read about Galileo Galilei and his fight against the dogma and I understood what science means. Liebnitz and Newton. Gauss, Riemann, Lobačevskij. We can’t understand Einstein without knowing the giants before him. All of these giants were looking up. They were looking at the universe not just with the telescope but mainly with their brains, like Stephen Hawking did.\nAll of these great people were genious and led the progress of human kind, true leaders. But also humans. Karl Pearson (inventor of the measurement of the association) and Ronald Fisher (design of experiment, the rule of the p=0.05) were both Galton’s students. But they had a fight. Ronald Fisher left the department and moved to the Rothamsted Experimental Station where he conducted “agricultural” experiments. Without that fight betwen strong personalities we would not have the statistical methodology that allow us to conduct trials. To become a farmer is not a bad idea after all. I spent my childhood in my family farm (45.90771368396219, 13.439667443246693). And this is what I am going to do after the retirement. Work the soil and take picture of the universe, this is the plan. Thank you Ronald Fisher to show me the way.\nThe analysis of claims and hospital data was very popular and colleagues from Company B were sending me data from every italian region for the analysis. Here I’d like to mention another gentleman. Gianni Dall’Asta. For 7 years we have been wrangling the italian territory and we were well known in so many hospitals. I remember two distric manager, Maria Grazia Fattori and Maria Grazia Sona. Commercial yes, but with the appropriate use of the medicines in mind. Great people and friends.\nThen Simvastatin went generic, amlodipine was already a mature brand. Company B had to re-org. The consultant agency came in. The new face of the company turned out to be extremely commercial. Already at that time the healthcare system was asking for quality of the information. The biggest problem of any health care system when it comes to treatment of chronic disease is the compliance and adherence. Despite the investment, patients have an adherence of 50-60%. So the benefit promised by the trials won’t happen. I saw this problem in the clinic and in the data. Many publications and books on this phenomenon, still largely unsolved. I believe that this is an area where the collaboration with institutions, GPs, pharmacies could be really fruitfull and increase the appropriate use of the drugs while increasing the business. Win-win situation.\nFew months later, in 2007, I left Company B and joined Company C. I changed city where, again, I did standard Medical Affairs activities. I was responsible for rosiglitazone. Few months later a meta-analysis from Nissen was suggesting CV risk (congestive failure). In 24 hour I repeated the analyis and found that by changing the method to deal with missing data the meta-analysis was not significant any more. This was admitted later one by Nissen himself and further studies contradicted the meta-analyis. But the damage was done and a good drug killed in unclear circumstances. Three unremarkable years. Standard people (maybe big ego but scratching the surface..nothing). But I have been lucky and met Antonio Chiapperini. Marketing. The intellectual exchange has been always very interesting and stimulated my curiosity a lot. Music for example. Thank you Antonio for introducing me to Eddie Vedder. I still listen Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, Soundgarden while I lift weights, every day since 1982.\nI can only happily remember the good relationship and the fun with the diabetologists community during the usual congresses (ADA, EASD). Thank you Prof Agostino Consoli for your friendship. Thank you Ele Ferrannini for your friendship. Thank you Stefano Del Prato. Thank you Prof Enzo Bonora for the trust.\nThe company especially at Global and Regional level had no view on the disease. Only on brands. Not good enough for me.\nEarly 2010 I got a call from Company D. They were looking for someone taking over a big observational study (the NIS, PCD or RWE terminology was not known, yet). I happily joined the Development organization and led this 55000 patients study.\nWhen the data came in the story I told in front of the Steering Commettee was succesfull and after the primary publication we had 60 more (one per country with different angles).Thank you Chantal Mathieu for supporting my story.\nI was in heaven. By pooling together all the trials from the compound I was working on plus this observational study I had available 100.000 patients records to mine. A gold mine.\nUntil then I used STATA as statistical package. And it’s a fantastic package used mainly by academia. Point and click and coding were both possible. The problem was the handling of the computer memory. And the data in the repository where stored in SAS which requires coding and learning the sintax. I learned statistics by myself why not learning how to code ? I started to learn coding. I learned SAS. Full immersion. It took awhile to master the underpinning concept. And I have understood another important lesson. A good medical advisor must know the basic of programming. The design of a good experiment, the reading of an article, asking advices to a statistician require some basic principle of programming.\nI started to mine the data of other compounds and I was lucky and asked to setup a new team (Medical Analytics) to mine all the data we have but also to train the medical organization to become more data driven. I failed. I had 7 statisticians and I spent months to train those statisticians on the diseases in order to let them understand the design of the trials we had to mine. And spent months to educate medical colleagues on how to ask questions, how to shape queries in a language understandable by statisticians and programmers. But no time to show to the rest of the organization what we were doing and the many publications we had. Politics has never been my strenght.\nEarly 2015 and my professional life changed. The fashion and fluff took over. Big Data, RWE, Machine Learning. Just new names for old stuff. The new management was dazzled by these rings and bells. Payers and local decision makers want to have evidences on the value of the drugs with local data. I know how difficult is to have access to local data. Data from US are not applicable in Japan. In real life the drugs are used differently by different health care systems. Local data, local contracts to get the data, local policies for the anonimization. RWE teams have to be delocalized. I knew that by experience.One big RWE central team is not ideal. Company D decided otherwise. Three years later the central team was dissolved.\nAfter years and millions spent for setting up platforms (plural on purpose) the key issue is still there, open. Or even worsened. The digital environment we are living in requires some familiarity with coding or at least the logic underpinning the coding. Without the notion of string we can’t understand the text mining used to extract information from EMR or sentiment analysis from a social network. It’s not just a technical detail. It’s the core of the knowledge required to perform any job in the industry. A market research or survey without asking the right question too many times opens the door to ambiguous answers. It’s also essential to understand the report from the CRM (customer relationship management system).\nAnyways, I left the RWE team before its dissolution because I was asked to take over the Medical Affairs team responsible of drugs on the market since decades. A dinosour among dinosours. Old drugs but key questions still open. Without resources we are still having posters approved at ADA, EASD, IDF even without any external big name. Again, important questions, good science make the difference among the scientific community. My view, as physician, is that the reputation, credibility and ethics of the industry (of this kind of business) lie on good science.\nIn 2000 I learned HTML, Java and Javascript because to give classes at University level I have generated the training material on a website with all the functionalities available at that time. After a while I learned SAS. Eventually I learned R. The programming environment and culture has evolved a lot. Within R, with few lines of code is possible to perform a literature serach on medline, extract the information from all the papers and perform the meta-analysis. In one go. It’s possible to generate interactive visualization of the data, any data. I generate this website within R.\nI think we should learn from the universe. For the 2nd law of thermodynamic the entropy will increase until the dissolution of the universe (but don’t worry because the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology , according to Sir Penrose, our universe eventually will be recycled).\nIn the end digital is a cultural thing not a function. We wouldn’t be impressed by what can be done with AI or ML if we know how the magic happens.\nI believe that investing in the content (the knowledge) is the best investment possible. How drugs should be used and how are used in real practice. Any correction needed ? How to solve the problem of adherence. I don’t see any more values around the appropriate used of the drugs among the companies values and behaviours. There is a website listing company by company values and behaviours. Probably the same few agency are designing the strategy of many companies. I see words like leadership everywhere but I don’t know what this means. I hope its not the number of followers on social media. When I walked in the NIH Nobel Prize Hall of Fame I saw what being a leader means. Like Gauss “pauca, sed matura”."

    "text": "and more importantly, this is my preferred channel of communication with my son Niccolo’. This is how I keep the dialogue with my son despite I never lived with my family because of my job. Good manners, discipline with diet and physical exercise is my legacy (and some good book).\nFerrara (Italy). The town where I spent 15 years of my life. Six years for the Medical degree, 5 years for the specialization in Endocrinology and Metabolism and 4 or 5 for my PhD. That is the entrance of my first gym in 1982 (Via XX Settembre). It’s still there. I think it was the time of the first Rambo movie.\n \nI started, as many of us at that time, without guidance. No Internet. No magazines. The gym was fairly well equipped but the notion about the importance of the diet was not emphasized as much as today. My diet was poor. My meals were mainly those from the University cafeteria or milk and biscuits when prepping exams (easily 15 hours of study every day). I don’t remember my exercise routines.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor sure I didn’t know or felt and leveraged the muscle-mind connection. But I have been consistent. Consistently inefficient. I got the medical degree in 1987, then spent 15 months in the army. I started my specialization in Endocrinology and Metabolism in 1990.This picture was taken I guess in 1992, before leaving for Graz where I spent one year and joined a local gym. I knew that someone important in the world of bodybuilding came from Graz. I knew only much later that his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew years later I was in US as fellow in the Frederikson lab at NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda (below is the picture of the Building 10 where my lab was located). I was living In Rockville and the name of the Gym was Aero-Flex. It was in Fisher Lane.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things I remember. The gym was gigantic (in my view at that time). I was already there at 6 am. And at 8.30 am I was in the lab. Again the diet was poor and probably also my routines. I don’t remember me doing squat or dead-lift. Big mistakes that are affecting my overall structure and strength. I regret I missed those two fundamental exercises.\nAt the age of 39, after my dreams of academia career where broken in pieces and I joined the pharma industry, I moved to Pisa.\n\n\n\n\n\nI joined a local gym and despite a growing family (Edoardo was one year old) and a job requiring frequent traveling I was still motivated and doing my best. Probably trying to keep my protein intake as much as possible high but no mayor improvements. I don’t think I was taking anything, not even proteins powder.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000 I moved to Mestre (Venice). My second son (Niccolo’) was coming and if I remember I have not able to train for a couple of years or maybe more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor sure I started to train again in 2004. At that time the stress was very high (company re-org) and I got panic attacks and psoriasis. I didn’t join any gym but I bought basic equipment and trained at home. Then I moved to Verona in 2007 and joined a local gym.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010 I moved to Basel (CH) where I joined the company training facility. Internet started to provide tips and videos. The diet was completely wrong and I gained roughly 8 kg, fat mainly.\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 I training more consistently.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 61, now I’m training at home and care more about the diet.\nWhat I have learned in these years:\n\nconsistency: diet (more important) and training\ncompound multi-joints movements are extremely important especially at the beginning of the session\nsquat: light or heavy but squatting often is the key for longevity which translates in self-sufficiency at older age. I have two hernias documented via RMN but no pain since I squat regularly\nMind-muscle connection: this is the principle that guides any movement or exercise. The weight per se is not important as compared to the mind-muscle connection. The time under tension and the quality of the contraction are affected by this connection. The warming up at the beginning is only partially referring to the thermogenesis. Sets with light weight, someone call them the feeling sets, are meant to develop the connection between the brain and the muscle in order to have the former governing the latter and not vice-verse.\nmulti-frequency: training the same group of muscles at least 2-3 times per week. 40 sets for big muscles per week and maybe 30 sets per week for the smaller. One session lasts roughly one hour. Session of short duration are a way to overcome the boredom of doing over and over again the same exercise with the same intensity. No doubts that high volume works. But keep it up for 40 years is challenging.\nwalking > 5-6 km per day (or equivalent). This helps to keep the metabolism up. I use this time to prepare my meetings mentally. Probably not every day but it’s very effective to lose weight or fat.\n\nI’m not a bodybuilder. However I’m using and learn every day bodybuilding techniques to mantain or improve, if possible, flexibility and strength.\nI think bodybuilding techniques could help geriatricians and physiotherapists. Probably in 5 years this will be mainstream.\nWhat I don’t follow because I think is wrong is the extreme reduction in body fat pursued in US. The US stereotype pushes for bodies with < 10 or even 5 % of fat. 10 % is for kids or for the stage (I think Mr Olympia should change parameters). I think thresholds should be adjusted for age and there are tables indicating the most correct body composition. Like for BMI epidemiloogical studies indicate an increase in mortality for extremely low or high body fat percentage. Bodybuilders on stage show < 5% of body fat. I doubt it’s healthy.\nTRT (testosterone replacement therapy in the range 200 mg /week) as a way to take testosterone inappropriately. Looking at youtube videos it seems that TRT is the most natural things to do to replace the natural drop in testosterone in plasma with age. Champions proudly share that are on TRT after they have been abused steroids for years. This is how it works in US.\nLike for estrogens in women, testosterone in men should be replaced only in case of signs or symptoms of deficit. I don’t think that the natural sarcopenia age-related is a valid motivation. It’s a misuse."

    "text": "At he end of the ’80 I started working on blood sample from patients. I was analyzing the potassium distribution in patients with different diseases. I had a lot of samples but few insights. I started then to do some math by hand and finally asked for help to the hospital statistician. It was taking ages to analyse my data. When I started doing by myself I understood why. I learned that the most time consuming step , apparently useless, is the data entry and cleaning. But here is where the magic happens. Cleaning the data is not trivial. For example, what to do with missing data ? the missing is not just missing. It provides some information that can’t be dismissed or replaced without some hypothesis around that missing. It also says something around the quality of the data.\nSo I started to entering the data manually in excel and then transfer them in Systat. Point and click. Easy.\nBut why click on this button and not on that one ? Why a t-test and not a chi-square or anova ?\nI started to dive in. Not in the theory of statistics but in the life of those people that generated the statistical techniques. I wanted to know what kind of questions they were trying to answer with their silly formulas.\nI read all the above books and more. Below are few concepts distilled from the books that are the basis of everything we know nowadays, including Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nGalileo Galilei suggested the repetition of the experiment as source of knowledge (not the dogma or belief).\nIs not possible to know/measure the truth. With a probabilistic approach we take an “educated guess”\nA good portion of statistics is based on the measure of variability.\ndifference between groups / difference within groups , signal to noise ratio\n\nBelow a short list of legends. It is just a sample, completely arbitrary. The contribution of Fermat, Graunt, Pascal, Huygens and the Bernoulli family (from Basel), Euler (from Basel) and many, many more was essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescartes\n1596-1650\nanalytical geometry (y,x axis plot)\n\n\nJacob Bernoulli\n1655-1705\nLaw of large numbers\n\n\nThomas Bayes\n1701-1761\nBayes theorem\n\n\nLaplace\n1749-1827\nCentral Limit Theorem (uncertainty decreases with the increase of the observations)\n\n\nLegendre\n1752-1833\nmethod of least squares (later Standard Deviation)\n\n\nWilliam Playfair\n1759-1823\nvisualization (graphs)\n\n\nKarl Gauss\n1777-1855\nNormal (bell) curve, distribution\n\n\nGeorge Boole\n1815-1864\nBoolean algebra\n\n\nFrancis Galton\n1822-1911\nRegression\n\n\nCharles Peirce\n1839-1914\ninference from sample to population\n\n\nAndrei Markov\n1856-1936\nMarkov Chains\n\n\nKarl Pearson\n1857-1936\nCorrelation\n\n\nGeorge Yule\n1871-1951\nOdds Ratio\n\n\nGeorge Snedecor\n1881-1974\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n\n\nSir Ronald Fisher\n1890-1962\nDesign of Experiment, ANOVA, ANCOVA, test of significance (p values)\n\n\nFrank Wilcoxon\n1892-1965\nranking method, nonparametric test\n\n\nJerzy Neyman\n1894-1981\ntest of hypothesis (null and alternative) Confidence Intervals, sampling\n\n\nAustin Hill\n1897-1991\nrandomization in trials\n\n\n\nToday we have many terms such as statistics, analytics, data mining or Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and they are seen as different. They are using all the same above building blocks but with a different approach and scope.\nAnother thing they have in common is the knowledge of the field of application. In the many blogs and training courses and videos available online, data scientists omit to say that from data cleaning to data insights some knowledge of the context is needed. Data scientists can not work in isolation. Oversight from an expert in the field of application is absolutely necessary.\nIt’s difficult to set boundaries between those disciplines but there are many Venn diagrams available online that are visualizing the overlap.\nTechnology allowed the harvesting of massive amount of data of different nature, more or less structured. The need to get insights from big data made necessary to expand the statistical framework. Hence the development of the Data Mining framework.\nStatistics often deals with test of hypothesis on relatively small datasets normally generated by specific experiment done to answer specific questions.\nWith more data available (Big Data) the emphasis was more on data visualization (sometime in real time) and reports easy to understand. The interest is more on the trend and the behaviours of variables. I like to think of an evolution of what it was called descriptive statistics (in the end it’s just tables and plots). So, Data Mining approach can be seen as a way to explore Big Data.\nIn statistics many models have been generated and within the statistical approach they are used one by one based on the nature of the data (Lineal models, logistic, survival, etc). The aim is to understand the interplay among variables and to quantify the association between predictors (independent variables) and predicted (dependent or outcome). By using those models, implicitly, we make assumptions about the nature of the association (like with the linear models). Another key element in statistics is that the full dataset is used.\nIn Machine Learning, philosophically, we use the same approach Galileo Galilei suggested more than 500 years ago. We learn by observing the same phenomenon many times. The machine (our laptop) learns by tacking one small sample of our dataset and try to map trends in this small sample. Then the machine re-run (bootstrap) this map (the new tentative model) many times on more little samples until this map describes well the data. The machine guesses many times until it gets lucky and finds the way to link the data to a behaviour. Often the link is completely unclear (black box) and this means that we normally donßt get coefficients like in the linear models as main output. The final model is then deployed (in production). However the model gets better as more data are coming in.\nSo these are the main features of the Machine Learning (ML) technique:\n\nthe scope of the technique is to provide a model able to predict and classify (not to estimate the difference or the risk). Predict if the new patient is at risk of some disease or if the next customer is a good customer or what he could buy along with the first item.\nThe machine doesn’t use the full dataset at once but in small samples\nthe ideal use of the model is not to understand a definite dataset but to be deployed on a system where new data are coming in and a prediction is needed in real time\nthe output of a model is not a set of coefficients (as the number of predictors) but mainly just the accuracy of the model\n\nThe ML has been divided in supervised when the data are known and unsupervised when the data are unknown (even without any label on variables). The scope of the latter is just to cluster the variables by using the old Factorial and Principal Component Analysis techniques based and the concept of correlation (Karl Pearson). With the supervised techniques all the variables have a name (label) and therefore are known especially the independent variable which is used to test or as target to teach the machine how to guess the predictors.\nAnalytics is mainly referring to Data Mining and Machine Learning approaches."
