Evidence Generation is a process. In the life science sector it goes like this:

A\) framing the question

B\) check the known (literature) and/or data available (databases, registries)

C\) based on the refined query to opt for:

1.  evidence synthesis with/without meta-analysis

2.  generate new data a) with randomized b) observing a cohort (Priimary Collection of Data)

3.  re-use existing data generated for different purposes (Secondary Use of Data)

Each chapter has tons of books and articles available.

The most important piece in the process is to clearly define the objective of the study and its end-point. These can't change along the execution of the study.
